# Employee Roster

## Description
*A simple web application that allows the user to store, view, add, delete, and edit a database of company employees.* 

## Details
- ASP.NET MVC application that uses Entity Framework for data access and the Code First workflow.
- The application includes Home, About, Employees, and Contact pages. Will add supplementary pages as need arises. 
- The majority of content on Home and About pages is Lorem Ipsum. Contact page has the actual info for current employer. 
- Employees page is a database of some of the current LMHA employees where the user can view and manipulate the data. 
- There are currently 3 classes in the Models folder: Employee, Employment, and Position. Position entity is not currently utilized. 
- Enum EvalScore is also not currently utilized but will be used at performance reviews. 

## Instructions
- If styles are not working in the browser reload with F5, Ctrl+r, or Command+r. It did the trick for me. :-)
